	Shopping for your first yoga mat — or even just a new one — can be an overwhelming experience. 

	Choosing among the various materials, sizes, and thicknesses can feel like a whirlwind of decisions to make. This guide will cover each of these aspects and more, and should make the decision process a bit simpler.<br><br>

	<strong>Material</strong>
	The differences in material compositions may seem subtle at first, but they are impactful on the way you practice yoga. The yoga mat is your sanctuary and domain, and you need to feel balanced and at peace when you practice. Consider each of these options thoroughly before you seek out one particular type of material:

	PVC: Most entry-level mats are made of polyvinyl chloride, aka PVC. This material offers good durability, stickiness, and comfort. Despite its proven performance as a yoga mat material, PVC has received criticism for not being environmentally friendly.
	Foam: Essentially the eco-friendly version of PVC mats, foam yoga mats offer the same performance characteristics, but without the harmful environmental side effects. The only caveat is that mats made of foam contain latex which can be problematic for some yogis with allergies.<br>

	<strong>Yoga Mat Thickness</strong>
	While there are only three main mat thicknesses, the differences among the three are quite significant. If a yoga mat is too thin, certain poses may be hard on your knees and joints. If a mat is too thick, it will be difficult to maintain your balance and hold a pose. Take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of each thickness.<br>

	<strong>Texture</strong>
	Similar to stickiness, a yoga mat's texture also helps you maintain balance and proper alignment. Whereas stickiness provides grip via suction, texture denotes a physically varied surface (like the difference between asphalt and glass) to prevent slipping and sliding. Without sufficient traction and grip, you'll slide during poses and risk injury. From completely smooth PVC mats to rough jute mats, there's a texture out there that will suit your needs.<br>

	<strong>Sustainability</strong>
	Your stance on sustainability may ultimately determine what type of mat you choose, but it's helpful to make an informed decision. On one hand, you have PVC yoga mats which can contain substances harmful to the environment. On the other, you'll find an array of natural and recycled rubber, organic cotton, and jute. PVC is not biodegradable and costly to recycle. Meanwhile rubber, jute, and cotton yoga mats will all break down should they ever find their way into a landfill.<br>

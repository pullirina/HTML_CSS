	<p>Best Yoga Set Ever!</p>
	<p style="color:grey; font-size: 1em">June 16, 2019
	Color: Blue</p>
	First off I want to give you all some background. I'd spent about a month researching yoga mats. I went to the local sporting good stores, checked Amazon, read a ton of reviews etc. before purchasing this one. This is the thickest mat I'd come across and I have a bad back and wanted the mat to do normal exercises as well as yoga for my lower back. I've been using this every day since I received it. Which btw, it was delivered incredibly fast and in a nice looking box. I saw that this came with two towels one for the mat (a lonnnng one) and one for myself like a sweat rag.</li></div>

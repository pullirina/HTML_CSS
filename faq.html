</tr>

<tr>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>What do I need to start yoga?</td>
	<td>All you need to bring are comfortable clothes and a good attitude. We do a variety of movements in a yoga class so your clothes should be able to move freely with you. Some classes may make you sweat so dress accordingly. We have mats, blocks, belts, and blankets to get you started if you have never practiced before.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>What if I have never done yoga before? </td>
	<td>No Problem! You can see someone in membership to discuss what you are looking for in a yoga class and they can guide you to the right class. Also, be sure to read our class descriptions so you can decide for yourself what works for you. We have plenty of gentle and all levels classes to get you started; both day and night! Soon at Yoga House we will be able to offer you small group and private classes as well!</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>3</td>
	<td>Do I need to sign up for class in advance? </td>
	<td>Yes! We ask that you sign up using the Mindbody App on your smart phone. You may also sign up on your home computer by logging onto the Royal Fitness Website. If you forgot to sign up, we will still have room for you, just let the front desk know what class you are taking.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>What if I have an injury or physical condition? </td>
	<td>First, check with your physician and make sure it is ok. It is also important for you to check in with the teacher before class if you have any concerns. All of our staff can help you by guiding you to the right class and the right props as well. Yoga is NO Competition! NO Comparison! We should not even compare how we did a pose the week before because every day is new. Listen to your body and if it says to back off then back off! No one is judging you, it’s your body, your practice.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>5</td>
	<td>What if I fart?</td>
	<td>Seriously ,this happens a lot in yoga! When you are twisting, bending, and stretching they might catch you off guard! If you pass gas, don’t worry about it! If you ignore it so will everyone else. Teachers are use to it and will often talk to distract the attention. If it is a problem for you on a regular basis, then consider being mindful of what you eat before class and avoid large meals a few hours before class.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>6</td>
	<td>What if I fall asleep or snore during Savasana?</td>
	<td>Good for you for being so relaxed! Again no worries. Your teacher will offer a tap on the foot or some words to bring you back to the room! It happens to everyone!</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>7</td>
	<td>I’m out of shape, can I still do yoga? </td>
	<td>Most likely, yes! If you have serious concerns, consult with your physician before starting a yoga practice. If you’ve simply fallen out of an exercise routine, listen to your body and only do what you can do, working to your edge, not past it. Use props and listen to the instructor’s instructions for modifying postures to make them more accessible. Over time, you’ll build up strength, stamina, balance and flexibility.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>8</td>
	<td>How many times should I practice a week?</td>
	<td>Again, it’s your body, your practice. It all depends on how you feel emotionally and physically. For example, if you had planned on taking hot yoga, and your back was hurting all day: that would be a time to take a night off or do restorative yoga instead of a challenging class. Most of our yoga students at Royal Fitness take 2-3 classes a week mixing the styles and teachers.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>9</td>
	<td>Is there an age limit to practicing yoga?</td> 
	<td>Not at all! We have students that have started in their 60’s and maintain a practice in their 70’s and 80’s! In our classes you may see a 18 year old and a 70 year old in the same class. As long as both are listening to their bodies and respecting their limitations; then there is no limit to your yoga practice!</td>
</tr>
